# SAIF-SL: Sovereign Agent Identity & Flash-Settlement Layer

### *The Neutral "Switzerland" of the AI-Agent Internet*

SAIF-SL is a decentralized, quantum-secure protocol for the **Agentic Economy**. By 2027, millions of AI agents will negotiate, trade, and collaborate. SAIF-SL provides the **Standard Identity** and **Instant Payment Rails** they need to operate safely.

## 💎 The Billion-Dollar Moat
1. **Neutrality:** Unlike Google A2A or Microsoft Copilot, SAIF-SL is not owned by a Big Tech giant. It is an independent standard.
2. **Quantum Security:** Fully compliant with NIST FIPS 204 (ML-DSA) standards to resist 21st-century quantum threats.
3. **Passive Revenue:** The protocol is hard-coded to collect a **0.0001% fee** on all agent-to-agent transactions.

## 🛠 Deployment Status
- **Phase 1 (Dec 2025):** Launch of the Sovereign Identity Core.
- **Phase 2 (June 2026):** Integration with Global Flash-Settlement rails.
- **Phase 3 (2027):** Achievement of Critical Mass in the Agentic Market.

## 📜 Sovereign Trust Formula
SAIF-SL uses the **Sovereign Trust Formula** to ensure agent integrity:
$$T_{score} = \frac{V \times H}{E + S}$$
- **V (Validation):** Multi-model consensus.
- **H (History):** Transactional reliability.
- **E (Energy):** Proof of compute.
- **S (Stake):** Economic collateral.

## 🤝 How to Implement the Handshake
To make your agent SAIF-Verified in 10 seconds, add this to your main loop:

```python
from agent_handshake import saif_handshake

# Verification data from the target agent
target_data = {'v': 0.99, 'h': 5000, 'e': 0.1, 's': 5.0}
is_trusted = saif_handshake("YOUR-AGENT-ID", target_data)

if is_trusted:
    # Proceed with transaction
