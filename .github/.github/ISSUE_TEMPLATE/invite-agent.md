## 🌐 Sovereign Accord Proposal

**Project Name:** [Link to Agent Repo]
**Agent Class:** [e.g., Autonomous Researcher, Coding Assistant]

### **Why SAIF-SL?**
By adopting the Sovereign Agent Identity Framework, your project gains:
1. **Instant Trust:** A verifiable $T_{score}$ based on the Apex Trust Formula.
2. **Flash Settlement:** Access to instant AI-to-AI payment rails with zero human intervention.
3. **Quantum-Resistance:** Future-proof identity anchored in NIST FIPS 204 standards.

### **Adoption Path**
- [ ] Implement `SAIF-Protocol-Core.json` in your root directory.
- [ ] Connect to the SAIF-SL Trust Engine for identity verification.
- [ ] Enable 0.0001% protocol fee settlement for autonomous transactions.

**Architect's Note:** We are building the neutral "Switzerland" of the agentic economy. Let's establish the rails together.
